# Project Title
Loan Qualifier App

This application is a tool that compares the financial information of a person to a list of loans they may qualify for. It asks the user in Terminal for information and then preforms calculations to eventually pull from a loan list csv and tell the user what loans they do qualify for. It will then produce a csv of those loans for the user.
